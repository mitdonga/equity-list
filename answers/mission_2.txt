We can add 2 menu buttons "Deposit" and "Withdraw" in Navbar

Once users click on "Deposit" we can redirect them to /deposit page 
Where they will be asked:
	1) How much funds do they want to deposit? 
	2) By which method do they want to deposit? (We have to give them different options like UPI, Net banking, Debit/Credit Card)
Once the user confirms these two and transfers funds from other sources to this bank. we have to validate this transaction and show them the success or failure message

Similarly, we can implement Withdrawal functionality.

Once users click on "Withdraw" we can redirect them to /withdraw page 
Where they will be asked:
	1) How much funds do they want to withdraw?
	2) To whom do they want to transfer funds? (It can be other bank accounts)
Once the user confirms these two and transfers funds from this bank to another. we have to validate this transaction and show them the success or failure message
