Dear Dr. V. Horrible,

We've identified an issue with your $10,000 wire transfer to Startup X. It was received, but a technical glitch caused a delay in reflecting it in your account. 
We've now corrected this and your funds are available.

Please accept our apologies and let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Mit Donga
Customer Support Team
